# Adaptive LSTM (aLSTM)

[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) implementation of the adaptive LSTM ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08574](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08574)). 

aLSTM is an extension of the standard LSTM that implements adaptive parameterization. 
Adaptive parameterization increases model flexibility given a parameter budget, allowing
more flexible and statistically efficient models. The aLSTM typically converges faster
than the LSTM and reaches better generalizing performance. It also very stable; no need to
use gradient clipping, even for sequences of up to thousands of terms.

## Requirements

This codebase should run on any [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) version, but has been tested for v2â€“v4. To install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flennerhag/alstm; cd alstm
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

This implementation follows the official LSTM implementation in the official (and constantly changing) 
[PyTorch repo](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch). We expose an ``alstm_cell`` function and its ``aLSTMCell``
module wrapper. These apply to a given time step. The ``aLSTM`` class is the primary object. To run the aLSTM,
use it as you would the ``LSTM`` class:

```python
import torch
from torch.autograd import Variable
from alstm import aLSTM

seq_len, batch_size, hidden_size, adapt_size = 20, 5, 10, 3

alstm = aLSTM(hidden_size, hidden_size, adapt_size)

X = Variable(torch.rand(seq_len, batch_size, hidden_size))
out, hidden = alstm(X) 
```

## Contributions

If you spot a bug, think the docs are useless or have an idea for an extension, don't hesitate to send a PR! 
If your contribution is substantial, please raise an issue first to check that your idea is in line with the 
scope of this repo.  Quick wins that would be great to have are:

- Support for bidirectional aLSTM
- Support PyTorch's PackedSequence
